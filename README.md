# Otter: The Information Dashboard

The contributors to this project were:

## The Planning Process

We took time before writing any code to develop an Entity Relationship Diagram laying out our database relationships. This is shown below:

We also created a basic wireframe for what we wanted our application to look like.

## Why is the application called Otter?

Otters are social animals. They hold hands while sleeping so they don't drift apart from each other. We named this application Otter to represent staying connected to one another with this information dashboard.
